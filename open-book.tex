\textbf{EEE122 Examination Guide Sheet}

This sheet, and its contents that you have added, can be brought into
the examination for EEE122. The contents \textbf{must} be compiled
by yourself, be handwritten, and be original (i.e. \textbf{NOT} 
photocopied or similar). You may use the
reverse side. You may retain a copy you have made before the examination
but the original must be handed in with your examination scripts at the
end of your examination.
